# Smart Irrigation



The Smart Irrigation System leverages AI/ML algorithms to automate irrigation decisions based on real-time environmental data. Instead of using fixed schedules, the system predicts whether a crop requires watering by analyzing patterns in sensor data using a machine learning model like Random Forest classifier.
